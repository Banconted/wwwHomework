      Cheese is a dairy product produced in a range of flavors, textures, and
      forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and
      fat from milk (usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats or sheep). During
      production, milk is usually acidified and either the enzymes of rennet or
      bacterial enzymes with similar activity are added to cause the casein to
      coagulate. The solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and
      pressed into finished cheese.Some cheeses have aromatic molds on the rind,
      the outer layer, or throughout.
